                <p>Pets are the best for people to have as they will never make you feel alone and can help you with your mental state.</p>
                <p>Some pets can even learn tricks and they are even loyal to their owners like dogs can be trained to be guard dogs or police dogs. police dogs can even be trained to find drugs or other substances. Even the military has dogs that are trained and when they get released from the military they can be adopted by people so they can be in a good home. </p>
